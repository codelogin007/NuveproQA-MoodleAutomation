# Guided (practice project) — derived gap cases, no-provisioning batch:
# CGAP-PGG-13/14 (student role split), CGAP-PGG-16/17 (config toggles), CGAP-PGG-15 (date validation).
# Student cases seed a fresh user via WS (deleted at teardown). The date-validation case runs on the
# existing guided activity's edit form — the validation error means NOTHING is saved (safe).
# Run: mvnw test -Dcucumber.tags="@guidedgaps"
