# Moodle settings (core admin config, no cloudlabs) — Site administration > Grades > Grade category
# settings / Grade item settings. @SET-<n> maps 1:1 to the 'Moodle settings' sheet in
# MoodleRegression_Testing_Kiwi.xlsx, numbered by row order starting after the sheet's preamble
# row (row 3 = SET-1). This batch = the High-priority rows only (Grade category/item settings +
# the derived role-gate gap row 81/SET-79), per CLAUDE.md "Automate High then Medium first".
# Medium-priority rows (Course default settings, Activity chooser, Running Banner) are the next batch.
#
# Scope note: SET-51..SET-58 ("...with Advanced option enabled" / "...should not be excluded by
# default...") are interpreted as covering BOTH values (Yes/No) of each Yes/No field plus its paired
# "force" checkbox, since the sheet's wording for that block is ambiguous about which value is the
# real default vs which is a value-under-test — verified defaults (SET-48, SET-51 baseline) come
# straight from the live site, not from the sheet text. SET-70/SET-71 ("Advanced grade item options")
# are a real grade item's edit-form behaviour, not a site-wide setting, so they need an actual course
# grade item and are config-gated on COURSE_ID until one is available.
